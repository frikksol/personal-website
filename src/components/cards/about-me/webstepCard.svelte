  <p class="text-lg">
    In 2023 I started a new chapter as a Senior Consultant in Webstep. As
    someone that has mostly worked in Startups, this was a big change for me. My
    first and current project is at Statnett, which manages Norway's power grid.
    <br /><br />
    At Statnett I am working as a solution architect on a an internal tool, with
    a Java backend and Angular frontend which runs on OpenShift.
