<StandardCard title="Integrations Lead at Unloc [2021-2023]">
  <p class="text-lg">
    In 2021 I started working at Unloc, which builds a platform for digital keys
    and the surrounding infrastructure. They connect smart door locks with the
    management systems and build the infrastructure for integrating the with
    service providers etc. I started as a Platform Developer and, after 8 months
    I changed position to be Integrations Lead; managing the integrations with
    with lock systems. In that position I did backend and app development,
    communications with integrations partners and support.
    <br /><br />
    The backend is written in Typescript, runs on Google Cloud on a mix of CloudFunctions
    and CloudRun, while the app is currently a flutter app where a large portion
    is native, written in Java/Kotlin and Swift.
