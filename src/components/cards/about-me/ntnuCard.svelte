    From 2010 to 2015 I was a student at the Norwegian University of Science and
    Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, Norway. I specialized in Signal Processing,
    Acoustics and Media. It was during my studies I realised that I really loved
    programming and decided to pursue a career in software development instead
    of electronics.

    The topic of my masters was parametric analysis of vibration sensor data from
    Rolls Royce Marine Propulsion Systems.
