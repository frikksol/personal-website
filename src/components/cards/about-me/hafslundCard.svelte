<StandardCard title="Tech Lead for Hafslund Flex [2024-Present]">
  <p class="text-lg">
    In 2024 I started a new position as tech lead for Hafslund Flex. This is an
    initiative within Hafslund Vekst, focusing on aggregating power flexibility
    and selling this in flexibility markets. One key tech takeaway from this
    project is setting up the entire CDK stack for local development. This in
    practice means having all relevant AWS services available for local
    development, which is awesome.
