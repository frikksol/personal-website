  <p class="text-lg">
    In 2021 I started working at Unloc which is my current employer. We build
    digital keys and infrastructure by building a system for integrating digital
    lock systems and building the infrastructure for integrating with said
    locks. I started as a Platform Developer and after 8 months I changed
    position to be Integrations Lead; managing the integrations we do with lock
    systems. In my current postion I do backend and app development,
    communications with integrations partners support.
