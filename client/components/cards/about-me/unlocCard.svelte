  <p class="text-lg">
    In 2021 I started working at Unloc which is my current employer. We build a
    platform for digital keys and the surrounding infrastructure. We connect
    smart doorlocks with the management systems and build the infrastrucutre for
    integrating the with service providers etc. I started as a Platform
    Developer and after 8 months I changed position to be Integrations Lead;
    managing the integrations we do with lock systems. In my current postion I
    do backend and app development, communications with integrations partners
    and support.
    <br /><br />
    The backend is written in Typescript, runs on Google Cloud on a mix of CloudFunctions
    and CloudRun, while the app is currently a flutter app with a large portion is
    native, written in Java.
