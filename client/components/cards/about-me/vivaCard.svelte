  <p class="text-lg">
    From 2018 to 2021 I worked at Viva Labs building a white-label smart home
    platform I started as an Embedded Devveloper, devloping the firmware that
    runs of the smart home hubs. These were either screenless Linux machines or
    Android devices. They all had either zigbee, z-wave or both, Wi-Fi, Bluetoot
    and some had ethernet. I was a part of devloping drivers for all these
    protocols and client software communcating with our AWS cloud over MQTT.
    <br /><br />
    After I year I took over the CTO position when the founder/CTO decided to pursue
    other things. As CTO I also had personell responisibilty for 13 Employees and
    several conultants. I also wrote a lot of backend code in Java, managed our AWS
    servers and did a lot of App development on our hybrid Javascript/Swift/Kotlin
    app.
