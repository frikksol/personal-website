I love
        building software of all kinds; serious, funny, big and small, but my
        love really lies where software makes things happen in the physical
        world. <br><br> My root and background is in electronics, but I quickly realized that I enjoyed
        software development way more, and switched my career in that direction.
        I like to see myself as a bit of a potato developer; working all the way
        from embedded C through the backend to different types of frontends. The
        one area where I feel I have been lacking is in the UI department, which
        is also the main motivation for building this website from the ground up,
        to learn the ropes, and familiarize myself with web technologies.</p> <div class="flex flex-row justify-center pt-12"><a href="https://github.com/frikksol"><img class="mx-8 my-2 h-16 w-16 rounded-xl border-2 border-black p-3 xl:mx-12 bg-white bg-opacity-70 hover:bg-opacity-90" src="github.webp" alt="github"></a><!----> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fhsolberg/"><img class="mx-8 my-2 h-16 w-16 rounded-xl border-2 border-black p-3 xl:mx-12 bg-white bg-opacity-70 hover:bg-opacity-90" src="linkedin.webp" alt="linkedin"></a><!----></div></div></div> <!--[--><div class="grid grid-cols-1 gap-0 px-6 pb-12 xl:px-52"><div class="my-6 h-fit w-auto rounded-xl border-2 border-black xl:my-12"><div class="h-auto w-auto rounded-t-xl border-b-2 border-black bg-white bg-opacity-40 p-4"><h1 class="font-sans text-lg font-semibold uppercase">Tech Lead for Hafslund Flex [2024-Present]</h1></div> <div class="h-auto w-auto rounded-b-xl bg-gray-50 p-4"><!----><p class="text-lg">In 2024 I started a new position as tech lead for Hafslund Flex.

    and selling this in flexibility markets. One key tech takeaway from this
    project is setting up the entire CDK stack for local development. This in
    practice means having all relevant AWS services available for local
    development, which is awesome.</p> <h1 class="pt-4 font-semibold">Tags:</h1> <div class="space mt-2 flex flex-row flex-wrap">Kotlin, Postgres, AWS, AWS CDK, Localstack</div><!----></div></div><!----> <div class="my-6 h-fit w-auto rounded-xl border-2 border-black xl:my-12"><div class="h-auto w-auto rounded-t-xl border-b-2 border-black bg-white bg-opacity-40 p-4"><h1 class="font-sans text-lg font-semibold uppercase">Senior Consultant at Webstep [2023-2024]</h1></div> <div class="h-auto w-auto rounded-b-xl bg-gray-50 p-4"><!----><p class="text-lg">In 2023 I started a new chapter as a Senior Consultant in Webstep.

    and the surrounding infrastructure. They connect smart door locks with the
    management systems and build the infrastructure for integrating the with
    service providers etc. I started as a Platform Developer and, after 8 months
    I changed position to be Integrations Lead; managing the integrations with
    with lock systems. In that position I did backend and app development,
    communications with integrations partners and support. <br><br> The backend is written in Typescript, runs on Google Cloud on a mix of CloudFunctions
    and CloudRun, while the app is currently a flutter app where a large portion
    is native, written in Java/Kotlin and Swift.</p> <h1 class="pt-4 font-semibold">Tags:</h1> <div class="space mt-2 flex flex-row flex-wrap">TypeScript, Javascript, Google Cloud, API's, Kotlin, Flutter, Java</div><!----></div></div><!----> <div class="my-6 h-fit w-auto rounded-xl border-2 border-black xl:my-12"><div class="h-auto w-auto rounded-t-xl border-b-2 border-black bg-white bg-opacity-40 p-4"><h1 class="font-sans text-lg font-semibold uppercase">Technical Director at Viva Labs [2018-2021]</h1></div> <div class="h-auto w-auto rounded-b-xl bg-gray-50 p-4"><!----><p class="text-lg">From 2018 to 2021 I worked at Viva Labs building a white-label smart home
    platform. I started as an Embedded Developer, developing the firmware that
    runs of the smart home hubs. These were either screenless Linux machines or
    Android devices. They all had either zigbee, z-wave or both, Wi-Fi,
    Bluetooth and some had ethernet. I was a part of developing drivers for all
    these protocols and client software communicating with our AWS cloud over
    MQTT. <br><br> After a year I took over the CTO position when the founder/CTO decided to pursue
    other things. As CTO I also had personnel responsibilities for 13 Employees and
    several consultants. I also wrote a lot of backend code in Java, managed our
    AWS servers and did a lot of App development on our hybrid Javascript/Swift/Kotlin
    app.</p> <br><br> <h2 class="text-lg font-bold">Some of the coolest projects I did in Viva:</h2> <h2 class="text-lg">Tailored Android OS to run as a smart home device frontend:</h2> <p class="text-lg">Tight integration into the Viva platform, Kiosk mode, customizing the
    dropdown-menus, adapting zigbee-drivers to run on Android, update services,
    device onboarding flow etc.</p> <br> <h2 class="text-lg">Developed built-in Alexa support on an Android device:</h2> <p class="text-lg">Adapt Alexa SDK to run on device, built messaging system between OS and
    Alexa SDK, collaborate with hardware vendor to optimize audio and hardware
    configuration for Alexa, Amazon Alexa certification etc.</p> <br> <h2 class="text-lg">Built MQTT-support into our app:</h2> <p class="text-lg">For a smart home system running on MQTT, it was beneficial to add leverage
    this app side as well due to its amazing speed. On completion, feedback
    speed on for example turning on a light was reduced from average ~1.5 sec to
    ~0.2 sec which makes it feel almost instant.</p> <h1 class="pt-4 font-semibold">Tags:</h1> <div class="space mt-2 flex flex-row flex-wrap">Linux, C, C++, MQTT, AWS, Java, AWS, IoT, Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Z-wave, Alexa,

    a part of creating TrashTag. This was an initiative to leverage the use of
    "cheap" consumer sub sea ROV's, and outfitting these with sensors to log
    location and depth of marine trash. <br><br> The reasoning for the project was that marine trash is a huge problem, and using
    divers to search for, and retrieve, said trash is a very expensive operation.
    Consumer ROV's equipped with sensors and logging systems, is a much cheaper solution,
    and based on the data, divers can to much more effective dives to retrieve the
    trash. In addition, these devices can be used as a learning platform for kids,
    students etc, where they can learn about how amazing the ocean is, while making
    a change at the same time. <br><br> The project was funded by the Norwegian Environment Agency (Miljødirektoratet).
    We were able to get prototypes up and running, but we were never able to finish
    the project fully since we later got "proper" jobs and needed to prioritize these.
    We however passed the project on to Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU),
    which continued working for a while. Now I am no longer sure. <br><br> NOTE: This project is not affiliated with trashtag.org if you try googling this.</p> <h1 class="pt-4 font-semibold">Tags:</h1> <div class="space mt-2 flex flex-row flex-wrap">OpenROV, Python, C, Subsea</div><!----></div></div><!----> <div class="my-6 h-fit w-auto rounded-xl border-2 border-black xl:my-12"><div class="h-auto w-auto rounded-t-xl border-b-2 border-black bg-white bg-opacity-40 p-4"><h1 class="font-sans text-lg font-semibold uppercase">Msc. in Electronics and Telecommunications [2010-2015]</h1></div> <div class="h-auto w-auto rounded-b-xl bg-gray-50 p-4"><!----><p class="text-lg">From 2010 to 2015 I was a student at the Norwegian University of Science and
