I love
        building software of all kinds; serious, funny, big and small, but my
        love really lies where software makes things happen in the physical
        world. <br><br> My root and background is in electronics, but I quickly realized that I enjoyed
        software development way more, and switched my career in that direction.
        I like to see myself as a bit of a potato developer; working all the way
        from embedded C through the backend to different types of frontends. The
        one area where I feel I have been lacking is in the UI department, which
        is also the main motivation for building this website from the ground up,
        to learn the ropes, and familirize myself with web technologies.</p> <div class="flex flex-row justify-center pt-12"><!> <!></div></div></div></div>`);function F(m){var a=u();h(c=>{var f=b();v.title="Frikk Herding",s(c,f)});var i=e(a),r=o(e(i),2),l=o(e(r),2),n=e(l);g(n);var p=o(n,2);w(p),t(l),t(r),t(i),t(a),s(m,a)}export{F as component,j as universal};
